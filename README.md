## What I Learned
- **API Integration:** Gained experience in fetching data from a third-party weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) and handling API responses.
- **React State Management:** Improved understanding of managing state for user input (city name) and API responses using `useState`.
- **Error Handling:** Learned how to handle errors gracefully, such as when a city name is invalid or the API request fails.
- **Conditional Rendering:** Applied conditional rendering to display different UI elements based on the application's state (e.g., loading, error, or data available).
